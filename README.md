## What is This
This repository is my sandbox for learning how to build a REST API. I built my API in Node.js and used Express. The API is hosted on heroku.
You can get a response from the API by visiting the [API link](https://intro-rest.heroku.app/api).

## Doing More
The API also has a different route, /hello, that accepts input appended to the URL. For example, fetching the route [https://intro-rest.heroku.app/hello/Your%20Name](https://intro-rest.heroku.app/hello/Your%20Name)
will return Your Name in a JSON. This can be seen in the [Github Pages](https://ryanjames1729.github.io/intro-rest/) I used to test this out.

That's it!
